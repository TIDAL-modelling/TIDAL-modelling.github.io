## Synthetic datasets

All datsets below have been simulated from their original data resources using the R package [synthpop](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/synthpop/index.html). These synthetic datasets do not contain any real participants.

To save the dataset click on the link below (right click to open in new tab) and then click `File` -> `Save Page As...` and save as a .csv file.
