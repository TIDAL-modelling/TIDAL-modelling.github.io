## Synthetic datasets

Synthetic datasets are provided to download and use with the [online application](/docs/installation/Online). These synthetic datasets have been simulated from their original data resources using the R package [synthpop](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/synthpop/index.html). They do not contain data on any real participants. The ["Emotional regulation synthetic dataset"](/docs/synthetic_data/emot_reg) is embedded within the TIDAL application as the "demo synthetic data".

Please see the pages below for documentation and download links for each synthetic dataset.
