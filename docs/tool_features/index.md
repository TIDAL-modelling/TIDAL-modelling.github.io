### Overview

The aim is for this digital tool to facilitate trajectories work and remove barriers to implementing longitudinal research to researchers without specialist statistical backgrounds. The following pages guide trajectory modelling and capture clinically meaningful features from mental health trajectories for specific individuals and/or specific groups of people. A more detailed description of each page is provided below with links to the full [walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWteXAWPBik). An instruction manual is provided [here](https://github.com/TIDAL-modelling/TIDAL/blob/main/Documentation/Instructions.pdf).
